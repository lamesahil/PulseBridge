Project Overview

PulseBridge predicts whether a tumor is Benign ✅ or Malignant ⚠️ using a Logistic Regression model trained on the Breast Cancer dataset. The system uses only the 10 most significant features for fast, accurate, and interpretable predictions.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, StandardScaler

Frontend/Deployment: Streamlit (interactive web app)

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, VS Studio

✨ Features

🧹 Handles missing values using mean imputation

📊 Standardizes inputs with StandardScaler

📈 Visualizes data distributions and feature correlations

💻 Real-time prediction through Streamlit UI

🔗 Easy integration with any frontend or API

🚀 Usage

Open app.py in Streamlit or Jupyter Notebook.

Input the 10 prominent feature values.

Receive a prediction: Benign ✅ or Malignant ⚠️.

🔮 Future Enhancements

🧩 Add feature importance charts for interpretability.

🌐 Deploy via Flask/FastAPI for external frontend integration.

📋 Enable batch predictions for multiple patient inputs.
